# Hi there, welcome! 👋

I'm a researcher and developer specializing in Machine Learning, specifically time series and data streams.

Most repositories here are complementary to my research papers or part of my ongoing work in building more robust and automated models for time series and data streams. 
If that interests you, let's get in touch and collaborate!
